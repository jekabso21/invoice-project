## Purpose
The frontend of the Invoice Project provides a dynamic and user-friendly interface for managing invoices, teams, and user accounts. It is designed to ensure seamless user interactions while maintaining high performance, scalability, and security.

The primary responsibilities of the frontend include:
- Allowing users to interact with the backend APIs for authentication, team management, and invoice handling.
- Managing user sessions to provide personalized and role-based access to features.
- Delivering a visually appealing and consistent UI using modern styling tools.

## Technologies Used

### Core Frameworks and Libraries
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and reduces runtime errors during development.
- **Next.js**: Provides server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for enhanced performance and SEO.
- **ShadCN**: Delivers a cohesive and accessible UI through reusable components.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Simplifies state management, enabling predictable and efficient handling of user and application data.

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Offers a utility-first approach to styling, allowing rapid customization of layouts and designs.

## Key Features

1. **Authentication and Session Management**
   - Secure login and registration processes.
   - Session-based access, with a 24-hour expiration for session data.

2. **Team Management**
   - Create and manage teams, including inviting and removing members.
   - Role-based access to team functionalities (e.g., admin and member).

3. **Invoice Management**
   - Create, view, update, and delete invoices.
   - Support for nested invoice properties (e.g., items, totals, due dates).

4. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Pages and features dynamically adapt to user roles and permissions.

5. **Notifications**
   - Alerts for pending invoices, expired invites, or team updates.

## Integration with Backend
The frontend communicates with the backend through a secure API layer:
- **Authentication**: Session IDs are used to authorize API requests.
- **Dynamic Data**: APIs handle team and invoice-specific data, ensuring up-to-date and accurate information for users.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling displays user-friendly messages for API failures.

## Deployment
- **Hosting Platform**: Vercel
  - Next.js is fully optimized for Vercel, offering fast builds and deployments.
- **Environment Variables**:
  - API base URL for backend communication.
  - Any additional configuration needed for third-party services.
