## Overview
The backend of the Invoice Project is built with **Golang** and uses the **Echo framework** for creating APIs. It employs **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication, with a dynamic implementation to enhance security. Additionally, the backend integrates plugins to seamlessly interact with **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB**, each serving specific roles in the system.

## Language and Framework

### Golang
**Purpose**:  
Golang is the backbone of the backend due to its robust performance and ability to handle concurrent tasks efficiently. It ensures a scalable and high-performance environment for managing API requests and database interactions.

**Why Golang?**  
- **Performance**: Golang compiles directly to machine code, making it fast and efficient.
- **Concurrency**: Built-in support for goroutines and channels enables handling multiple tasks simultaneously.
- **Reliability**: Strong type safety and minimal runtime errors.
- **Scalability**: Ideal for growing workloads and high-traffic applications.

**Advantages**:  
- Simplified deployment with a single binary output.
- Lightweight and optimized for cloud-native environments.
- Excellent ecosystem for building RESTful APIs and managing databases.

### Echo Framework
**Purpose**:  
The Echo framework is used to build a fast and structured API layer. It simplifies the process of routing, middleware integration, and error handling.

**Why Echo?**  
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead while providing essential features for API development.
- **Performance**: Optimized for low-latency and high-throughput operations.
- **Flexibility**: Easy to extend with custom middleware or plugins.

**Advantages**:  
- Built-in support for routing, request validation, and JSON handling.
- Modular structure allows for clean and maintainable code.
- Comprehensive middleware support for logging, error recovery, and authentication.

## Authentication

### JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
**Purpose**:  
JWT is used for authenticating users and managing sessions securely. A dynamic approach to JWT implementation ensures enhanced protection against unauthorized access.

**Why JWT?**  
- **Stateless**: No need to store session data on the server, reducing server load.
- **Compact**: Tokens are small and can be easily transmitted in headers.
- **Secure**: Supports encryption and signing to prevent tampering.

**Advantages**:  
- Flexible and scalable authentication mechanism.
- Can include custom claims for role-based access control.
- Expiration and revocation ensure limited token validity.

**Dynamic JWT Implementation**:  
The dynamic approach incorporates session-specific or time-sensitive elements, making tokens harder to decrypt and enhancing overall security.

## Database Plugins

### PostgreSQL Plugin
**Purpose**:  
PostgreSQL is used to store structured and relational data, such as user accounts and team information.

**Why PostgreSQL?**  
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data integrity and reliability.
- **Rich Querying Capabilities**: Supports complex queries and joins.
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets efficiently.

**Advantages**:  
- Robust transaction support for critical data operations.
- Strong ecosystem with tools for monitoring and management.
- Extensible with support for custom data types and functions.

### MongoDB Plugin
**Purpose**:  
MongoDB is used to manage unstructured and dynamic data, such as invoices and their associated properties.

**Why MongoDB?**  
- **Schema Flexibility**: Allows for storing complex and nested documents.
- **Scalable**: Optimized for horizontal scaling to handle large datasets.
- **Performance**: Efficient for read-heavy and write-heavy workloads.

**Advantages**:  
- Quick iteration for evolving data structures.
- Natural support for JSON-like documents simplifies integration.
- Indexing and aggregation capabilities improve query performance.

## Key Advantages of the Framework
- **Performance**: Golang ensures high throughput, and Echo provides a fast API layer.
- **Security**: JWT offers a stateless and secure authentication mechanism.
- **Scalability**: Optimized to handle increasing user demand with concurrent operations and robust database integration.
- **Flexibility**: Seamless integration with PostgreSQL for structured data and MongoDB for dynamic data ensures adaptability for various use cases.
